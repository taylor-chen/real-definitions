Just a random Chrome Extension for fun

What I want to do:
1.After a user selects text, a small popup box will appear above the text with the definition provided by Urbandictionary.com
2.On/Off button
3.Listen for when the user selects text

What it does now:
1.Definition appears in a html page opened by a button
2.Text often does not work on first try
3.Listener is based on button

Note: This is just the source and is not availiable on the chrome web store, you would have to load the extension yourself.
